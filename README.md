## Features

With the extended Wrap you can automatically make a default Flutter Wrap expand to its parent size and then you can 
specify how many children a Wrap should put on each run. Additionally you have some options to customize where the free 
space is put like for example placing the children on both sides with the free space in the center of the Wrap.

class ExtendedWrap {/*...*/}
class ExtendedWrapAlignment {/*...*/}
```
